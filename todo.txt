POS Pull request within the next 2 weeks should include:

.JSP pages & Servlets. The project should be extended to work with Tomcat and the DB can be created in-memory, since Prof. wants to later teach us how to setup secure databases.

The tomcat website should have the following pages:
--finished-- 1 page for listing all the entries of 1 table (e.g. list of all the music in DB). This may be done in w/e fashion but using datatables is highly recommended for now. There should also be a search bar that filters based on any of your desired columns (recommended are of course reasonable columns such as title or surname). This page may have a button for creating new records.

--finished-- 1 page for creating entries. Only display reasonable fields for input of data. (DON'T allow user to determine the ID and the version. The database & viennaruns.persistence layer are supposed to do it)

1 page for edit for 1 specific record. (Select path however you may see fit)

--finished-- 1 page for details of 1 specific record.

1 page for confirming delete of 1 specific record (optional-ish. But a delete functionality must be there.)

--finished-- _version row: update +1 on update, default 1

viennaruns.domain layer: validate 'set' values and use 'set' methods for constructor
